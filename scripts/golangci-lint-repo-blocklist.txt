# GolangCI-Lint Repository Blocklist
#
# This file contains a list of repositories to exclude from golangci-lint
# version checking. Repositories listed here will be skipped during scanning.
#
# Format: One repository per line
# Supported formats:
#   - owner/repo
#   - github.com/owner/repo
#   - https://github.com/owner/repo
#
# Lines starting with # or // are treated as comments and ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Common reasons to blocklist a repository:
#   - Repository intentionally uses an older version
#   - Repository is in maintenance mode
#   - Repository has special version requirements
#   - Known false positives
#
# Example:
# example-org/legacy-repo
# github.com/another-org/special-project
# https://github.com/third-org/archived-tool
