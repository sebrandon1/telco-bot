# TLS 1.3 Compliance Checker Repository Blocklist
#
# This file contains a list of repositories to exclude from TLS configuration
# compliance scanning. Repositories listed here will be skipped during scanning.
#
# Format: One repository per line
# Supported formats:
#   - owner/repo
#   - github.com/owner/repo
#   - https://github.com/owner/repo
#
# Lines starting with # or // are treated as comments and ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Common reasons to blocklist a repository:
#   - Repository intentionally uses InsecureSkipVerify for testing
#   - Repository has documented exceptions for TLS configuration
#   - Repository is a test harness or mock server
#   - Known false positives (e.g., security scanning tools)
#
# Example:
# example-org/tls-test-harness
# github.com/another-org/mock-server
# https://github.com/third-org/security-scanner
